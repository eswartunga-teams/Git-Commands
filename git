What is Git?
Git is a version control system (VCS) used to track changes in code over time. It helps developers keep a history of their code, collaborate with others, and manage code changes efficiently. Git is a command-line tool that allows users to perform actions like committing changes, branching, merging, and pushing code to remote repositories.

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git to host and manage repositories. It provides a web interface for Git repositories, allowing teams to collaborate on code, track issues, and manage projects. While Git is the underlying system for version control, GitHub adds features like pull requests, code review, and project management tools.

In short:

Git: The version control system that tracks code changes.

GitHub: The platform that hosts Git repositories and facilitates collaboration.
